# #These Settings Establish the Proper Database Connection for Heroku Postgres
# #The environment variable DATABASE_URL should be in the following format:
# # => postgres://{user}:{password}@{host}:{port}/path
# #This is automatically configured on Heroku, you only need to worry if you also
# #want to run your app locally
# configure :production, :development do
# 	db = URI.parse(ENV['DATABASE_URL'] || 'postgres://localhost:5432/mydb')
#
# 	ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
# 			:adapter => db.scheme == 'postgres' ? 'postgresql' : db.scheme,
# 			:host     => db.host,
# 			:username => db.user,
# 			:password => db.password,
# 			:database => db.path[1..-1],
# 			:encoding => 'utf8'
# 	)
